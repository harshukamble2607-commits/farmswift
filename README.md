 FarmSwift
Farm-Fresh Produce. Direct from Farmers. Delivered Swiftly.
FarmSwift is a multi-role farm-to-consumer platform designed to connect local farmers, customers, delivery partners, and administrators in one simple, lightweight system.
The platform removes middlemen, improves farmer income, and enables fast last-mile delivery — all without heavy backend infrastructure.
 Problem Statement
Small and local farmers often face:
Low profit margins due to middlemen
No direct access to digital marketplaces
Complex or expensive technology requirements
At the same time, customers struggle to get fresh, traceable produce, and delivery coordination remains inefficient.
 Our Solution
FarmSwift provides a role-based digital marketplace where:
Farmers list produce directly
Customers order fresh items
Admins manage orders and logistics
Delivery partners handle last-mile delivery
The entire workflow is managed using lightweight, no-code tools, making it affordable and scalable for real-world adoption.

 Development Note (Important)
FarmSwift is intentionally built as a single-file HTML application to ensure:
Fast prototyping during hackathons
Easy deployment without servers
Accessibility for non-backend developers
All UI, logic, and API calls are contained in one file, while the backend is powered by Google Apps Script + Google Sheets.
This approach proves that impactful systems can be built with minimal resources.
